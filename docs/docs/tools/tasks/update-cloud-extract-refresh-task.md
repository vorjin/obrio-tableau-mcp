# Update Cloud Extract Refresh Task

Updates the schedule of an extract refresh task on Tableau Cloud. Use this to change how often a refresh runs (e.g. downgrade Daily → Weekly), shift its time window, or modify the day/hour it executes — without recreating the task.

:::warning Admin Only
This tool is restricted to Tableau site administrators and requires the `ADMIN_TOOLS_ENABLED` environment variable to be enabled.
:::

:::info Tableau Cloud Only
This tool calls the **Cloud variant** of the update endpoint and is not appropriate for Tableau Server. The Server variant has a different payload shape and is tracked separately.
:::

## Confirm and audit

This mutation is **two-phase**, gated on a server-generated single-use confirmation token:

1. **Preview** (default — `confirm` omitted or `false`): reports the new schedule that would be
   applied without changing anything, and returns a single-use `confirmationToken`.
2. **Update** (`confirm: true` + `confirmationToken`): applies the schedule update. The server
   verifies and consumes the token first.

The token is server-generated and **bound to the previewed `taskId` and `schedule`**: a token minted
while previewing schedule A cannot confirm an update to schedule B, and a `confirm: true` with no
prior preview (no valid token) is rejected server-side. This gate genuinely requires the preview
phase to have run for exactly this change; it cannot be bypassed by computing a value. Present the
change to the user and get explicit approval before confirming.

### MCP-Apps confirm panel (cooperative human-in-the-loop)

When the `mcp-apps` feature flag is enabled, this tool ships with an MCP App and the
preview phase renders an in-iframe **confirm panel** describing the schedule change (new frequency and
time window, plus a live countdown) instead of returning preview text the model could act on. The
schedule change is then applied only when a person clicks **Apply schedule change** in that panel,
which invokes the model-invisible `confirm-update-cloud-extract-refresh-task` tool
(`visibility: ['app']`), passing the task id and the full structured schedule. With the flag on, the
model-driven `confirm: true` path is **closed** — the assistant cannot apply the change on the user's
behalf; the only route is the human gesture. The confirm tool verifies a fresh, single-use human
approval recorded during the preview (within `MUTATION_PREVIEW_TTL_MINUTES`, default 5); a missing or
expired approval rejects the update. When the flag is off the tool behaves exactly as the two-phase
`confirm`/`confirmationToken` flow described above.

:::warning[Cooperative, not server-enforced]
This is **cooperative** human-in-the-loop: it depends on the MCP client honoring `visibility: ['app']`
(hiding the `confirm-*` tool from the model) and rendering the confirm panel. The human approval is
recorded during the model-driven preview phase, so a **non-cooperating** client that ignores the
visibility hint could still drive `preview → confirm-*` back-to-back with no human gesture. This task
tool has **no tag layer** — the app approval is the only gate — so a non-cooperating client has nothing
else to clear (the schedule-bound registry nonce still proves a preview *ran*, but not that a human
approved). Server-enforced HITL (an approval primitive the model cannot forge or reach) is tracked as
follow-up work (W-23125362).
:::

:::note[Authoritative audit]
Every attempt — both the preview and the confirmed update, and both allowed and denied attempts (for
example a non-admin caller) — emits a structured authoritative audit record to the server's durable
log sink (logger `audit`, level `notice`), not just to the tool-response text. Each record captures
the actor identity, the tool, action (`update`), phase, the target id, the confirmation evidence kind
(`registry-nonce` for this tool), and the result. A confirmed update emits an `allowed` record when
authorized, then a terminal `completed` (or `failed`, with `failureDetail`) record reflecting the
REST outcome — so the trail records what actually happened, not just intent. This routing is
centralized in the shared mutation guard so every TMCP mutation tool audits identically.

## APIs called

- [Update Cloud Extract Refresh Task](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_extract_and_encryption.htm#update_cloud_extract_refresh_task)

## Use cases

Use this tool when you need to:
- Reduce the frequency of an under-used extract refresh (e.g. Hourly → Daily, Daily → Weekly)
- Move a refresh window to off-peak hours
- Change the recurrence intervals (e.g. weekday → weekend)

## Required permissions

- **Tableau Cloud**: Requires `tableau:tasks:write` OAuth scope
- **Site Role**: Must be one of:
  - SiteAdministratorCreator
  - SiteAdministratorExplorer
  - ServerAdministrator

## Configuration

Enable this tool by setting:

```bash
ADMIN_TOOLS_ENABLED=true
```

See also: [Environment Variables](../../configuration/mcp-config/env-vars.md)

## Arguments

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `taskId`   | string (UUID) | Yes      | The ID of the extract refresh task to update. Obtain from `list-extract-refresh-tasks`.    |
| `confirm`  | boolean | No      | Set `true` to apply the update (requires `confirmationToken`). When omitted or false, previews the change without applying it. |
| `confirmationToken` | string | No | The single-use token returned by a prior preview of this same `taskId` and `schedule`. Required when `confirm` is `true`; ignored otherwise. A token minted for a different schedule will not validate. |
| `schedule` | object | Yes      | The new schedule to apply. Replaces the existing schedule wholesale.                              |

### `schedule` shape

| Field                                | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frequency`                          | enum     | Yes      | One of `Hourly`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`.                                                           |
| `frequencyDetails.start`             | string   | Yes      | Start time in 24-hour `HH:mm:ss` format, e.g. `"06:00:00"`.                                              |
| `frequencyDetails.end`               | string   | Hourly only | End time in 24-hour `HH:mm:ss` format. **Required** for `Hourly` (minute portion must match `start`, must be strictly after `start`). Omit for `Daily`/`Weekly`/`Monthly` — Tableau ignores it. |
| `frequencyDetails.intervals.interval` | array    | No       | Recurrence intervals. Each entry can specify `weekDay` (Sunday..Saturday), `monthDay`, `hours`, or `minutes` depending on the frequency. |

### Schedule constraints

The schema enforces these rules — invalid input is rejected before any Tableau API call:

- **Time format** – `start` and `end` must be zero-padded `HH:mm:ss` (e.g. `"06:00:00"`, not `"6:00:00"`).
- **Minute boundary** – The minute portion of `start` (and `end`, when present) must be on a 5-minute boundary: `00`, `05`, `10`, `15`, `20`, `25`, `30`, `35`, `40`, `45`, `50`, or `55`, with seconds = `00`. `07:26:00` is rejected; `07:25:00` and `07:30:00` are accepted.
- **Hourly** – `start` and `end` must share the same minute portion (e.g. `06:00:00`/`18:00:00` ✓, `06:00:00`/`18:30:00` ✗); `end` must be strictly after `start` (numeric comparison, not lexical).
- **Daily / Weekly / Monthly** – `end` is ignored — omit it.
- **Hourly** and **Daily** require at least one interval with `weekDay` (Tableau rejects them otherwise with `409004`).
- **Weekly** requires at least one interval with `weekDay`; **Monthly** requires at least one interval with `monthDay`.

Tableau may still reject a schema-valid request with `409004 Conflict` (`Invalid subscription schedule`) for site-specific rules. In that case the tool surfaces Tableau's structured error verbatim — e.g. `Tableau 409 [409004]: Conflict: Invalid subscription schedule. (...)` — so callers can recover without parsing axios errors. A 404 is mapped to a "Tableau Cloud only" hint pointing at `list-extract-refresh-tasks` since the most common cause is calling against a Tableau Server site or with a stale taskId.

## Example: Daily → Weekly Sunday at 06:00

```json
{
  "taskId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "schedule": {
    "frequency": "Weekly",
    "frequencyDetails": {
      "start": "06:00:00",
      "intervals": { "interval": [{ "weekDay": "Sunday" }] }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Hourly between 08:00 and 18:00 every 2 hours, Mondays

```json
{
  "taskId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "schedule": {
    "frequency": "Hourly",
    "frequencyDetails": {
      "start": "08:00:00",
      "end": "18:00:00",
      "intervals": { "interval": [{ "hours": 2 }, { "weekDay": "Monday" }] }
    }
  }
}
```
