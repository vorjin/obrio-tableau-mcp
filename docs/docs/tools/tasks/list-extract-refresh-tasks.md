# List Extract Refresh Tasks

Retrieves a list of extract refresh tasks for the Tableau site. Each task describes a scheduled refresh for a data source or workbook extract and includes schedule information (e.g. frequency, next run time, schedule name on Server).

:::warning Admin Only
This tool is restricted to Tableau site administrators and requires the `ADMIN_TOOLS_ENABLED` environment variable to be enabled.
:::

## APIs called

- [Get Extract Refresh Tasks](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_extract_and_encryption.htm#list_extract_refresh_tasks_in_site)

## Use cases

Use this tool when you need to:
- See which data sources or workbooks have extract refresh schedules
- Find the refresh schedule (frequency, next run time) for specific datasources or workbooks
- List all extract refresh tasks on the site
- Analyze extract refresh patterns for schedule optimization

## Required permissions

- **Tableau Cloud**: Requires `tableau:tasks:read` OAuth scope
- **Tableau Server**: Users see only tasks they own unless they are site or server administrators
- **Site Role**: Must be one of:
  - SiteAdministratorCreator
  - SiteAdministratorExplorer  
  - ServerAdministrator

## Configuration

Enable this tool by setting:

```bash
ADMIN_TOOLS_ENABLED=true
```

See also: [Environment Variables](../../configuration/mcp-config/env-vars.md)

## Arguments

This tool takes no arguments.

:::note API Limitation
The Tableau REST API does not support filtering or pagination parameters for extract refresh tasks. All tasks are returned in a single request. For sites with many extract refresh tasks, consider using client-side filtering based on the returned data.
:::

## Response structure

Each task includes:

- `id` – extract refresh task ID
- `datasource.id` or `workbook.id` – the target data source or workbook
- `schedule` – frequency, nextRunAt, and (on Tableau Server) name, state, id
  - `frequency` – Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Hourly
  - `nextRunAt` – ISO 8601 timestamp of next scheduled run
  - `frequencyDetails.intervals` – detailed interval configuration (hours, minutes, weekDay, monthDay)
