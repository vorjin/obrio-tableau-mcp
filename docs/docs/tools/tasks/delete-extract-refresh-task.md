# Delete Extract Refresh Task

Deletes an extract refresh task from the Tableau site. This permanently removes the scheduled extract refresh — the underlying data source or workbook is not affected, but it will no longer be refreshed on this schedule.

:::warning Admin Only
This tool is restricted to Tableau site administrators and requires the `ADMIN_TOOLS_ENABLED` feature flag to be enabled.
:::

:::danger Destructive Operation
This operation is irreversible. The extract refresh task cannot be recovered once deleted. To re-enable scheduled refreshes, a new task must be created.
