# Request Overrides

Tableau MCP supports overriding certain configuration variables on a per-request basis via an HTTP header. This allows MCP clients to adjust server behavior for individual requests without changing the server's environment variables or site settings.

Request overrides are only available when using the [HTTP transport](http-server.md).

## Enabling Request Overrides

Request overriding is disabled by default. To enable it, the Tableau MCP server must specify which variables are allowed to be overridden and their [restriction type](#restriction-types) using the `ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES` variable.

### `ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES`

A comma-separated list of allowed [request overridable variables](#request-overridable-variables) and their [restriction type](#restriction-types).
This variable can be configured on a per-site basis when [`ALLOW_SITES_TO_CONFIGURE_REQUEST_OVERRIDES`](#allow_sites_to_configure_request_overrides) is `true`.

- Default: Empty string (request overriding is disabled)
- Use `*` to target all request overridable variables (when used, `*` must be specified first in comma-separated list).
- If a restriction type is not specified, the request override variable will be `restricted` by default.

:::info

Examples

```
1. ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES=INCLUDE_DATASOURCE_IDS,INCLUDE_WORKBOOK_IDS:unrestricted

2. ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES=*:unrestricted,MAX_RESULT_LIMIT:restricted,MAX_RESULT_LIMITS:restricted

3. ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES=*
```

Result in the following:
1. only `INCLUDE_DATASOURCE_IDS` (restricted) and `INCLUDE_WORKBOOK_IDS` (unrestricted) are allowed as request overrides.
2. all request overrides are allowed and unrestricted, except for `MAX_RESULT_LIMIT` and `MAX_RESULT_LIMITS` which are restricted.
3. all request overrides are allowed and restricted.

### `ALLOW_SITES_TO_CONFIGURE_REQUEST_OVERRIDES`

When `true`, sites can specify their own set of [`ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES`](#allowed_request_overrides), see [Site Settings](site-settings.md).

- Default: `false`
- When `false`, sites can not specify their own set of [`ALLOWED_REQUEST_OVERRIDES`](#allowed_request_overrides).

## Restriction Types

Each allowed request override variable has a restriction type that determines what values are permitted as overrides.

### `restricted`

When a variable is restricted, request overrides can only narrow or maintain the current configuration. They cannot expand access or remove limits.

### `unrestricted`

When a variable is unrestricted, request overrides can set any valid value, including values that expand beyond the current configuration or clear existing limits.

## Providing Request Overrides

When making a [tool call](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/tools#calling-tools) request, overrides can be specified using the `x-tableau-mcp-config` HTTP header. The header value is a string of key-value pairs separated by `&`.

```
x-tableau-mcp-config: INCLUDE_TAGS=sales,marketing&MAX_RESULT_LIMIT=50
```

- Each key must be a [request overridable variable](#request-overridable-variables).
- Each key must have a value (the `=` sign is required). An empty value (e.g. `MAX_RESULT_LIMIT=`) is valid and is used to override a variable to its default value.
- Any unrecognized keys or invalid override values will cause the request to fail with an error.

## Request Overridable Variables

The following variables can be overridden on a per-request basis. Each variable has different behavior depending on whether it is `restricted` or `unrestricted`.

### [`INCLUDE_PROJECT_IDS`](tool-scoping.md#include_project_ids)

Overrides which project IDs constrain tool arguments and results.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | If there are any current bounds set, the override value must be a **subset** of the current bounds. Cannot clear existing bounds. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can be any valid set of project IDs, including values not in the current bounds. Can clear existing bounds with an empty value. |

### [`INCLUDE_DATASOURCE_IDS`](tool-scoping.md#include_datasource_ids)

Overrides which data source IDs constrain tool arguments and results.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | If there are any current bounds set, the override value must be a **subset** of the current bounds. Cannot clear existing bounds. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can be any valid set of data source IDs, including values not in the current bounds. Can clear existing bounds with an empty value. |

### [`INCLUDE_WORKBOOK_IDS`](tool-scoping.md#include_workbook_ids)

Overrides which workbook IDs constrain tool arguments and results.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | If there are any current bounds set, the override value must be a **subset** of the current bounds. Cannot clear existing bounds. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can be any valid set of workbook IDs, including values not in the current bounds. Can clear existing bounds with an empty value. |

### [`INCLUDE_VIEW_IDS`](tool-scoping.md#include_view_ids)

Overrides which view IDs constrain tool arguments and results.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | If there are any current bounds set, the override value must be a **subset** of the current bounds. Cannot clear existing bounds. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can be any valid set of view IDs, including values not in the current bounds. Can clear existing bounds with an empty value. |

### [`INCLUDE_TAGS`](tool-scoping.md#include_tags)

Overrides which tags constrain tool arguments and results.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | If there are any current bounds set, the override value must be a **subset** of the current bounds. Cannot clear existing bounds. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can be any valid set of tags, including values not in the current bounds. Can clear existing bounds with an empty value. |

### [`MAX_RESULT_LIMIT`](env-vars.md#max_result_limit)

Overrides the global maximum number of results for tools with a `limit` parameter.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | Override value must be **less than or equal to** the current limit. Cannot clear existing limit. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can be any positive number. Can clear existing limit with an empty value. |

### [`MAX_RESULT_LIMITS`](env-vars.md#max_result_limits)

Overrides per-tool maximum result limits.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | For tools that currently have a limit, the override value must be **less than or equal to** the current tool-specific limit. New tools added in the override must have a limit less than or equal to the `MAX_RESULT_LIMIT` value (which may have its own override value). |
| `unrestricted` | Override value can set any valid per-tool limits (either a positive number, or `*` for unbounded results). Can clear all per-tool limits with an empty value. |

### [`DISABLE_QUERY_DATASOURCE_VALIDATION_REQUESTS`](env-vars.md#disable_query_datasource_validation_requests)

Overrides whether query validation requests are disabled.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | Can only be overridden to `true`. |
| `unrestricted` | Can be overridden to `true` or `false`. |

### [`DISABLE_METADATA_API_REQUESTS`](env-vars.md#disable_metadata_api_requests)

Overrides whether Metadata API requests are disabled.

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | Can only be overridden to `true`. |
| `unrestricted` | Can be overridden to `true` or `false`. |

### [`STALE_CONTENT_MIN_AGE_DAYS`](env-vars.md#stale_content_min_age_days)

Overrides the default threshold (in days) used by the `get-stale-content-report` tool to flag stale workbooks and published datasources. Override value must be an integer in the range `1`–`3650`. Empty string reverts to the default (`90`).

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | Override value must be a valid integer in the range `1`–`3650`. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value must be a valid integer in the range `1`–`3650`. |

### [`STALE_CONTENT_MAX_ROWS`](env-vars.md#stale_content_max_rows)

Overrides the maximum number of stale-content rows the `query-admin-insights` tool (`kind: "stale-content"`) will return in one call. Above this cap the tool withholds the row payload and returns a `ROW_CAP_EXCEEDED` warning with the true total count. Override value must be an integer in the range `1`–`10000`. Empty string reverts to the default (`100`).

| Restriction Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `restricted` | Override value must be a valid integer in the range `1`–`10000`. |
| `unrestricted` | Override value must be a valid integer in the range `1`–`10000`. |

## Override Hierarchy

Request overrides are applied on top of site overrides and environment variables in the following order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **Request overrides** (per-request, via `x-tableau-mcp-config` header)
2. **Site overrides** (per-site, via REST API, see [Site Settings](site-settings.md))
3. **Environment variables** (server-wide)

For example, if the environment sets `MAX_RESULT_LIMIT=100`, a site override sets it to `50`, and a request override sets it to `25`, the effective value for that request is `25`.
