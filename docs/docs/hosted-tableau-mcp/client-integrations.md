# Popular Client Integrations
This guide walks you through everything you need to use Tableau MCP with popular third-party agents.

## Slack
You can connect Slackbot to Tableau MCP by installing the latest version of the [Tableau Slack app](https://slack-pde.slack.com/marketplace/A026RA4ND1R-tableau) into your workspace. 

### First-time Tableau Slack App installation
If it's your first time installing the Tableau Slack app, go to Tableau site settings for the Tableau site you want to connect Slack to. From site settings, click the `integrations` tab and scroll to the bottom of the page until you see the *Slack Connectivity* section. Click the `Connect to Slack` button and connect to your target Slack workspace by clicking `allow` from the app install dialogue.

<hr style={{margin: '2rem auto', maxWidth: '60%', border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-300, #dadde1)'}} />

<div style={{
  maxWidth: '380px',
  margin: '1.5rem auto',
  padding: '12px',
  background: 'var(--ifm-background-surface-color, #fff)',
  border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-300, #dadde1)',
  borderRadius: '10px',
  boxShadow: '0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12), 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)',
}}>

</div>

To confirm that the app installation completed, go to your slack workspace, click tools, apps, and look for Tableau in the list of installed apps. 

:::note 
This workflow does not block multi-site users from using Slackbot to interact with multiple Tableau sites. Tableau MCP uses a separate OAuth flow from inside Slackbot to connect users to their target site. 

Also, you cannot install the Tableau slack app from the Slack marketplace. You have to do it from the Tableau site settings. 

:::

### Using Tableau MCP from Slackbot
Once you've install the Tableau Slack app, users of the worksapce simply have to click the `apps` button inside Slackbot and connect to their target Tableau site through the built-in [OAuth](/configuration/mcp-config/authentication/oauth.md) flow. 

For more information about Slackbot and MCP server support, see [Slackbot documentation](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/slackbot-mcp-client/)

### Tableau Connector for Claude and Cowork
We'll be adding a Tableau connector to the Anthropic Marketplace soon. In the meantime, you can add Tableau as a custom connector.

### Claude Desktop Extension
*The Tableau Extension for Claude Desktop does not actually use the hosted service. Instead, like all Claude Desktop extensions, it is a bundle that contains all the Tableau MCP code and dependencies in a single `.mcpb` package. It uses Claude Desktop's native Node.js runtime. To use the Tableau extension, you must have installed [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).*

#### Step 1: create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Login to your site, then click your profile in the upper right to bring up My Account Settings.

Scroll down to Personal Access Tokens and create a new one. You can use any token name but something
memorable like "mcp" is suggested to make later configuration easier. Make sure to copy and save the
value because it's only shown this one time. (Also, be aware that, by default, Tableau PATs will expire after 15
days of inactivity, so you may need to periodically create a new one.)

<div style={{maxWidth: '75%', margin: '1rem auto'}}>

</div>

:::warning

Keep your PAT safe and don't share with anyone. Pay attention to the
expiration date; default expiration is 15 days. 

:::

Make note of these 4 values which you'll need later for the MCP configuration:

- SERVER (e.g. `https://10ax.online.tableau.com` or `https://tableau.example.com`)
- SITE_NAME (e.g. sales-official; on Server leave blank to use the default site)
- PAT_NAME (e.g. mcp)
- PAT_VALUE (value copied after PAT creation)

#### Step 2: Install Tableau MCP Extension

Option 1: Install from Claude Marketplace

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings | Extensions
3. Click on Browse Extensions
4. Search for Tableau and install it

Option 2: Install latest from Tableau MCP GitHub

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-mcp/releases)
2. For the newest release, under Assets, find and download the .mcpb file (it will be named
   something like "tableau-mcp-v1.15.0.mcpb")
3. Open Claude Desktop
4. Go to Settings | Extensions
5. Drag and drop the .mcpb file onto Claude Desktop

Once the extension is installed, you'll be prompted to configure Tableau MCP:

- SERVER
  - Cloud: pod hostname like `https://10ax.online.tableau.com`
  - Server: hostname like `https://tableau.example.com`
- SITE_NAME
  - Cloud: required, for example sales-official
  - Server: site name, or can leave blank to use the default site
- PAT_NAME (e.g. mcp)
  - The name of the PAT you created in the Tableau site settings
- PAT_VALUE (value copied after PAT creation above)

When everything is configured it should look like this:

<div style={{maxWidth: '75%', margin: '1rem auto'}}>

### Claude Code
Add Tableau MCP with the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http Tableau https://mcp.tableau.com
```

then restart your claude code session and run `/mcp` inside Claude Code and approve the Tableau sign-in:


Verify with `claude mcp list` or `/mcp`, then select `Tableau` and `authenticate`.
